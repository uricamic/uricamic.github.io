I am currently a senior researcher in the Rossum AI Labs, working on business document understading. 

I got Ph.D. (Artifical Intelligence) and MSc. (major: Computer Graphics, minor: Computer Vision) titles at Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Electrical Engineering. During my Ph.D. I spent 4 months on internship in prof. Sugimoto's lab at National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan. 

My working experience include automotive industry (Valeo Expert for Computer Vision) and audio (researcher at Altered, Ltd.).
